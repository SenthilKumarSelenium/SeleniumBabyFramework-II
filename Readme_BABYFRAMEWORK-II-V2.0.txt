Hi All,

I have implemented Selenium Baby Framework – II (V2.0) for selenium beginners. Only 10 steps enough to execute this framework.

Advantages:
1) Data Driven
2) Cross Browser(FireFox, IE, Chrome, Safari, HtmlUnit Driver)
3) Execute Multiple environment in single batch
4) Manage your modules and Test cases through XML
5) All reusable functions(babyfunction.java)
6) HTML Report Creation along with Summary.

PFA. Document Baby-II.doc(inside Document_10 steps folder) contains 10 steps along with screenshots. BABYFRAMEWORK-II -V2.0 folder contains entire framework structure.

For entire framework description (Create module, Test Case, Set test data, Set properties etc.,) and live execution available in the below YouTube URL

PART-1(Covers End to End Execution)
